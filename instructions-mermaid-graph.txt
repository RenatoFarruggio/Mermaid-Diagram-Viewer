Mermaid graph display

Please create a website (html, css, js) and whatever you deem necessary to create it. The website should:
- Have a text box field where I can input a valid mermaid classDiagram text.
- Have some sort of display to render the graph.
- The user should be able to drag around in the display with the right mouse click and dragging it.
- The user should be able to zoom in and out in the display by scrolling the mouse wheel.
- The user should be able to freely drag around the nodes by clicking on them with the left mouse button and dragging them around. The arrows and other edges should adapt accordingly, sticking to the nodes.
- It should have a easily toggleable dark mode.
- The default text in the textbox should be:
"""
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
    class Animal {
        +String species
        +makeSound()
    }
    class Dog {
        +bark()
    }
    class Cat {
        +meow()
    }
"""
