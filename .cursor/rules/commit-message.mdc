When the user enters the "/commit" followed by referenced files, please consider the changes in all of them (except for cursor rules) to create a commit message. Then follow these rules @https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/.

The changes are usually all changes since the beginning of the chat.

Please avoid fancy words like "enhance". Also try to use specific verbs instead of general verbs.

Please make each sentence complete the sentence "When applied, this commit will ...".
